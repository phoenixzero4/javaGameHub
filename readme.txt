
GameHub is a simple multi-threaded client-server program written in Java that facilitates group
chat and direct messaging. The program also hosts several simple games, also written in Java. The 
client GUI programs host Tetris, Tic-Tac-Toe and Snake and the non-GUI server program handles client
requests for multi-player gameplay (users can challenge other users to Tetris and Tic-Tac-Toe
matches).
